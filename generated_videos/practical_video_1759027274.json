        "Rapid montage: Face ID unlock animation (stylized), Netflix UI showing 'Recommended for You', a self-driving car icon on a map, a smart assistant device glowing.",
        "Quick, dynamic cuts between these visuals."

      "animation_notes": "Fast-paced, high-energy cuts. Text overlay 'ML in action!' flashes briefly.",

      "script": "At its core, Machine Learning lets computers learn from data *without explicit programming*. They identify patterns and make predictions. We primarily have two types: Supervised learning, like classifying spam emails, uses labeled data to predict outcomes. Think a teacher guiding the learning. Unsupervised learning, however, finds hidden patterns in *unlabeled* data, like grouping similar customers for marketing, without any prior guidance. ML powers everything from medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and recommendation systems to self-driving cars. Ready to dive in? Python with libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow are your go-to. Start with algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or K-Means.",
      "visual_cues": [
        "**17-23s (What is ML):** Simple animated diagram: 'Data In' -> 'ML Model (Learning)' -> 'Prediction/Output'. Text: 'Learn from data, no explicit programming.'",
        "**23-30s (Supervised):** Split screen. Left side: Pile of emails, some labeled 'Spam', some 'Not Spam', feeding into an ML model. Right side: A 'teacher' icon pointing to data. Text: 'Supervised: Labeled Data, Predict Outcomes (e.g., Spam Classification).'",
        "**30-36s (Unsupervised):** Transition. Scattered, unlabeled data points on a graph. Then, the points start to cluster naturally into distinct groups. Text: 'Unsupervised: Unlabeled Data, Find Patterns (e.g., Customer Segmentation).'",
        "**36-42s (Applications):** Quick cuts/icons representing applications: Medical cross with 'ML' brain icon, a lock/shield icon (fraud), 'Recommended for You' UI snippet, car driving on a road.",
        "**42-55s (Getting Started/Algos):** Python logo. Then, 'Scikit-learn' and 'TensorFlow' logos appearing next to Python. Finally, simple, distinct icons/representations for 'Linear Regression' (line through points), 'Decision Trees' (tree-like structure), and 'K-Means' (clustered dots)."
      ],
      "animation_notes": "Smooth transitions between concepts. Diagrams should be clear and concise, using minimal text. 'Teacher' and 'unlabeled' concepts highlighted visually. Logos and algorithm icons should pop in and out cleanly. Text overlays clarify key terms as spoken.",
      "audio_notes": "Explanatory, clear, and slightly varying pace to emphasize key terms (e.g., 'without explicit programming', 'labeled data', 'unlabeled data'). Enthusiastic when talking about applications and getting started. Maintain a steady, informative tone."
